This is the code to implement the robust particle filter (RPF) algorithm in the following paper
@inproceedings{liu2017robust,
  title={Robust particle filter by dynamic averaging of multiple noise models},
  author={Liu, Bin},
  booktitle={2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)},
  pages={4034--4038},
  year={2017},

}

If you use this code in your own work, please cite the above paper.

Before running the main function "main_rpf.m", you should install the lightspeed toolbox at first.
